Is It Down?
Inspired by Today’s Slack Outage :D
Standard Challenge:
Build a service that allows a user to register and ping any number of URLs to see if the service is down :stuck_out_tongue:
Display a list of the services, as well as their current status
Bonus Challenges:
Be able to Nest sub-services within a higher level one.  (For example: AWS has multiple regions each with their own status.  Slack has several different systems, each with their own status - chat, notifications, login)
Create the ability to ping on a frequency and refresh automatically
Combine multiple services into a high level “Is it Working” signal.  Ie. Slack + Email + Google => Lambda is Alive
General notes:
The Idea I want to emphasize with this challenge is Components.  Regardless of whether you’re a Fullstack, UX, or Datascience Student, what models can you come up with to make sure this is generic enough to serve ANY url or web service?
How will you represent the high level ideas behind ANY web service being available or not?
